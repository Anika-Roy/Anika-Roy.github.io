                    <h3>Schooling</h3>
                    <p> I studies in Lotus Valley Internation School Noida till 12th grade.
                        I pursued a lot of interests like theatre, singing, sports, astronomy, robotics 
                        and many more by joining clubs, taking part in competitions and going on club trips.
                        I scored a 98.2% in my 10th boards and 98% in my 12th boards. I also remained German subject topper 
                        for the 3 years I was learning it at school and I also proved my mettel in German Olympiads</p>

                    <h3>College</h3>
                    <p>Academically, I've been surprisingly doing extremely well in college getting a CGPA of 10 in sem1, 
                        9.62 in sem 2 and currently await the sem3 CGPA(I wanted to update it on the resume but the academic departemnt is yet 
                        to announce it)
                        I always wished to pursue research so my focus was mainly on college academics. However since the past sem, 
                        my interests have ventured far and wide and I'm currently exploring open source. My next stop would be thorough web
                         development and this website is just the beginning✨</p>

                    <p>I also earned a diploma in Kathak and a 2nd year keyboard certification in Indian Classical Music.
                        I participated in debates, MUNs, Symposiums and speeches pertaining to the topics I am very passionate about
                        like politics, modern colonisation, environment and ethics</p>
